To run the two similar environments: 
$ python similar_1.py 

OR

$ python similar_2.py



To run the two different environments: 
$ python different_1.py 

OR

$ python different_2.py

The model for all the tasks is defined in SimpleDQN.py. After completion of tests, the model would be stored in the results/ folder. Please rename after running one environment since all 4 tasks use the same model.
